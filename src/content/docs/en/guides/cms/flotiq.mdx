[Flotiq](https://flotiq.com) is a headless CMS designed for various frontends, such as static sites, mobile, and web applications. Developers and content creators manage and deliver content through REST and GraphQL-based APIs.


## How to use Flotiq headless CMS with Astro

In this tutorial, you will use the Flotiq headless CMS API from an Astro project and display content on your website.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need:

1. **An Astro project** - This project assumes you are using the [blog template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog). If you donâ€™t have an Astro project yet, follow the [Installation guide](/en/install/auto/) to get started.
2. **A Flotiq headless CMS account** - If you don't have an account, [sign up for free](https://editor.flotiq.com/register).
3. **Flotiq read-only API key** - Find out [how to obtain your key](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/).
### Prepare the Environment

Enter the read-only key obtained from your Flotiq account into the `.env` file.

```env title=".env"
FLOTIQ_API_KEY=__YOUR_FLOTIQ_API_KEY__
```

### Prepare Content Type Definition in Flotiq

1. Log in to your [Flotiq account](https://editor.flotiq.com).
2. Create a Blog Post [Content Type Definition](https://flotiq.com/docs/panel/content-types/) in Flotiq. Use the pre-defined blog type definition or create a custom model.
3. Create one or more [Content Objects](https://flotiq.com/docs/panel/content-objects/) in the BlogPost type.

### Connect Astro Component with Data from Flotiq

Fetch `blogpost` entries from the `/api/v1/content/blogpost` endpoint. Include your read-only API key in the request header. The API will return an array of your blog posts.

```astro title="src/pages/blog/index.astro" ins={7-17} del={4-6}
---
import FormattedDate from '../../components/FormattedDate.astro';

const posts = (await getCollection('blog')).sort(
  (a, b) => a.data.pubDate.valueOf() - b.data.pubDate.valueOf()
);
const posts = await fetch(`https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/content/blogpost?hydrate=1`, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-AUTH-TOKEN': import.meta.env.FLOTIQ_API_KEY
  },
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => {
    console.debug({responseFromFlotiq: response});
    return response.data;
  });
--- 
```
 
Modify the blog page to use the content returned from the fetch call.

```astro title="src/pages/blog/index.astro" ins={6-7, 10} del={4-5, 9}
posts.map((post) => (
 <li>
   <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}/`}>
     <img width={720} height={360} src={post.data.heroImage} alt="" />
     <h4 class="title">{post.data.title}</h4>
     <img width={720} height={360} src={`https://api.flotiq.com/${post.headerImage?.[0]?.url}`} alt="" />
     <h4 class="title">{post.title}</h4>
     <p class="date">
       <FormattedDate date={post.data.pubDate} />
       <FormattedDate date={new Date(post.internal.createdAt)} />
     </p>
   </a>
</li>
```


### Next steps

Next Steps:

Expand other pages, such as individual blog posts, to fetch data from Flotiq. This involves adapting the data retrieval logic to display detailed views for each post.

Refactor the communication with Flotiq into a separate service. By isolating the API calls, your project becomes more maintainable and scalable, making it easier to manage the integration points.

Utilize the Flotiq SDK for API interactions. The SDK simplifies working with the Flotiq API by providing convenient methods for fetching and managing content, enhancing the development experience and speeding up the integration process.
